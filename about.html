                <p>TechTutor was born out of a shared passion for technology and education. In 2023, a group of tech
                    enthusiasts and educators came together with a vision to create a platform that would make
                    high-quality tech education accessible to everyone. Recognizing the growing demand for tech skills
                    and the barriers many face in acquiring them, we set out to bridge this gap.</p>
                <p class="storyHeading">Growth & Expansion:</p>
                <p>As demand for our courses grew, so did our team and offerings. We added new courses in areas such as
                    data science, cybersecurity, and web development, ensuring that our curriculum remained relevant and
                    comprehensive.</p>
